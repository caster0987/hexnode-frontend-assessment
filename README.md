# Assessment Project

## Overview
This project is a part of my assessment where I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a fully functional web page. The objective was to demonstrate my understanding of web development fundamentals by building a project from scratch, implementing interactivity, and styling the page.

## Features
- **HTML Structure**: Built the structural foundation of the webpage using semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Styling**: Enhanced the aesthetics of the page with CSS for layout, colors, typography, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Implemented JavaScript to handle user interactions and dynamic content updates.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/assessment-project.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project folder and open `index.html` in your browser.

## How I Worked Through the Project
1. **Planning**: I started by outlining the requirements and visual layout, defining the core elements and their interactions.
2. **HTML Setup**: I created the HTML structure, ensuring semantic tags were used for better document organization and accessibility.
3. **CSS Styling**: I styled each component with CSS, paying attention to responsive design for various screen sizes.
4. **JavaScript Implementation**: Finally, I wrote JavaScript functions to add interactive features, such as event listeners for buttons and form validations.

## Usage
- **Run Locally**: Download or clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
- **Code Structure**:
  - `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure.
  - `xyz.css` - Contains CSS styles for layout and design.
  - `demo.js` - JavaScript file for interactive elements.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling language for layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for adding interactivity.
